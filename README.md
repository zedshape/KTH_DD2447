We turned off all the plotting code by commenting plt.plot() in.
If grader wants to check plots, please comment out them.

We added one more output in q3.py functions' (sis, smc_multinomial, smc_stratified) to calculate likelihood while predicting.
We decided to leave it as it is one of the key property of plots.

So if grader wants to restore initial state of output, please kindly remove that part.
